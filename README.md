# On-Weakly-Contracting-Dynamics-for-Convex-Optimization
This repository contains the extended technical report of the paper “On Weakly Contracting Dynamics for Convex Optimization” by Veronica Centorrino, Alexander Davydov, Anand Gokhale, Prof. Giovanni Russo, and Prof. Francesco Bullo, and the code needed to reproduce the simulations there presented.

The repository contains the files:

(i) 2024-extended_version_wc-dynamics_for_convex_optimization with the extended technical report of the paper “On Weakly Contracting Dynamics for Convex Optimization”.

(ii) 2024a-Numerical-Example.ipynb with the necessary code to reproduce the figures featured in the Numerical Experiments paragraph in the Tackling Linear Programs Section of the manuscript.


**Authors of the final code and figures: Veronica Centorrino**.
